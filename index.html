      <h1>TYpes of Pizza</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Neapolitan Pizza</li>
        <img src="images/pizzatypes-margherita-.jpg" />
        <p>
          Neapolitan is the original pizza. This delicious pie dates all the way
          back to 18th century in Naples, Italy. During this time, the poorer
          citizens of this seaside city frequently purchased food that was cheap
          and could be eaten quickly. Luckily for them, Neapolitan pizza was
          affordable and readily available through numerous street vendors.

        <li>Chicago Pizza</li>
        <p>
          Chicago pizza, also commonly referred to as deep-dish pizza, gets its
          name from the city it was invented in. During the early 1900’s,
          Italian immigrants in the windy city were searching for something
          similar to the Neapolitan pizza that they knew and loved. Instead of
          imitating the notoriously thin pie, Ike Sewell had something else in
          mind. He created a pizza with a thick crust that had raised edges,
          similar to a pie, and ingredients in reverse, with slices of
          mozzarella lining the dough followed by meat, vegetables, and then
          topped with a can of crushed tomatoes. This original creation led
          Sewell to create the now famous chain restaurant, Pizzeria Uno.

        <li>New York-Style Pizza</li>
        <img src="images/pizzatypes-deepdish.jpg" />
        <p>
          With its characteristic large, foldable slices and crispy outer crust,
          New York-style pizza is one of America’s most famous regional pizza
          types. Originally a variation of Neapolitan-style pizza, the New York
          slice has taken on a fame all its own, with some saying its unique
          flavor has to do with the minerals present in New York’s tap water
          supply.
